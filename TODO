 * TESTS

 * create a separate float type
 
 * parse simple character literals e.g. ?a ?\s ?\\ ... the rest can wait.

 * parse all the symbols on this page:
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Symbol-Type.html#Symbol-Type

 * look into na-cl for better performance

 * implement all Emacs Lisp types/objects on this page:
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Programming-Types.html#Programming-Types

 * relational operators: < > <= >= = not

 * special forms: lambda, cond, and, or, let, let*, letf, letf*

 * successfully interpret ~/config/emacs one sexp at a time

 * primitives: list/cons functions, string functions,
   	       apply, eval,
               require, provide

 * macros

 * dynamic scoping (replace the current symbol table entirely)
 
 * merge with Ymacs? (probably not going to happen, would have to
   steal what we can from them)

 * too many things to list at this point ... small steps
